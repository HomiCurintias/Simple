📘 SimpleScript Documentation
🧩 Overview

SimpleScript is a minimal interpreted language that supports:

File inclusion (include:)

Function definition (function: / endfunction)

Function execution (call:)

Printing (print:)

All interpretation logic is contained in:

simple.py


And the main execution script is:

main.py

📂 File Structure
project/
 ├── main.py
 ├── simple.py
 ├── main.txt
 └── lib.txt

📄 Language Syntax
1. Include Files

Includes another SimpleScript file to be executed before the current file.

include:
file_name


Example:

include:
lib.txt

2. Define Function
function:
function_name
    ...body...
endfunction


Example:

function:
hello
print:
hello world
endfunction


The function body is stored in memory and executed only when the function is called.

3. Call Function
call:
function_name


Example:

call:
hello

⚙️ Interpreter Workflow
📌 run_simple_script(filename)

Reads and interprets the file line by line:

When encountering include:, it imports another file.

When encountering function:, it stores the function in memory.

When encountering call:, it executes the function.

📌 define_function(name, body)

Stores the function name and body in a dictionary:

functions[name] = body


Outputs:

[OK] Function 'hello' defined

📌 call_function(name)

Finds the function and executes each line in its body:

Supports the print: command

Can be expanded to support variables, conditionals, loops, etc.

Outputs:

[CALL] Running 'hello'

🔧 Complete Example
lib.txt
function:
hello
print:
hello world
endfunction

main.txt
include:
lib.txt

call:
hello

Execution

Terminal:

python3 main.py


Output:

[COMPILER] Running script 'main.txt'
[COMPILER] Including file 'lib.txt'
[COMPILER] Running script 'lib.txt'
[OK] Function 'hello' defined
[CALL] Running 'hello'
hello world

🚨 Common Errors
❗ Function not found
[ERROR] Function 'hello' not found


Causes:

Function is defined after being called

Included file does not exist

function: block is incorrectly formatted

endfunction is missing

📦 Possible Extensions

Future improvements could include:

✅ Variables
✅ Function parameters
✅ Conditionals (if:)
✅ Loops (loop:)
✅ Math operations
✅ Bytecode generation
✅ Compilation to Python / C / Rust
